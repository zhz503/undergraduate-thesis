### Abstract

ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) as one of the exploitation equipment in offshore area, plays a very important role in the development of exploitation procedure. In the movement process, the uncertain factors such as sea undercurrent, reefs will greatly influent ROV, and in the operation process, ROV will also be affected by the water resistance, mechanical arm reaction and so on. To ensure the stability and effectiveness of the ROV in operation process, is the key to the research, which also puts forward the requirement of the ROV dynamic positioning.

Based on the engineering research of ROV, the paper firstly chooses a proper coordinate system. Then, the paper makes a force analysis to ROV and builds up a dynamic model for the force that it bears. Next, according to Newton classical kinematic law, the paper builds up a kinematic and dynamic equation for ROV, and realizes this equation with the algorithm. What’s more, through the study of the kinematic and dynamic modeling of ROV and the coupling calculation, the paper uses the PID control to control ROV’s position and attitude respectively, gradually makes ROV from the original position close to the expected position and finally locates to the expected position. Thus in this way the paper can realize the dynamic positioning of ROV in six degrees of freedom. 

Finally, in this paper, three different kinds of structure of the ROV are modeled by Simulink function of MATLAB simulation calculation, and the paper adds artificial interference of steady and unsteady flow as well as man-made desired position disturbance, thus verifies the feasibility of the ROV dynamic positioning with three different distribution of the propeller, and compares the simulation results and performance analysis.
